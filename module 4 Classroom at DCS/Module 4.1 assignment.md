# Module 4.1 Assignment

In this lesson, you learned how we organise organizations (sorry about the spelling) and Classrooms at The Department of Computer Science, University of Sheffield. Module leaders and teaching staff will be added to two types of organization. The first is called the master and acts as a holder for templates that can be used between year.
The second type of organisation is the iteration and is created for each individual year or semester of study. 
Each module using GitHUB, will have one master organization and then organizations for each iteration of the module (i.e., tous-dcs-COM1003-22-23, tous-dcs-COM1003-23-24, etc...). You would then have repositories that contain starter code for each assignment within the master organization. This will be useful if the instructors for a module changes, as the new instructors can be added to the master organization and they do not have to be added to an organization for one of the previous modules iterations.

Please Note: If you need an invite to a master or iteration GitHub organization for a particular module, please stop at this point and request one from stephen.a.potter@sheffield.ac.uk

Each module iteration for a particular year will then have a GitHUB classroom associated with it. When instructors create assignments they can use the template repos from the Master organisation for that module but because each classroom is associated with its own organisation the students' repos will be created in the iteration organisation for the current year or semester.

This structure is important as it keeps repos created by students organised and allows for easy reuse of templates for coming years of study. Please adhere to this structure if you can. If there is a good reason for not organising things in this way contact stephen.a.potter@sheffield.ac.uk

Your assignment is now to create your assessments in your classrooms and use the features provided. The following article has some interesting insights into the use of GitHUB classroom in teaching programming. Particluarly section 4 Resources and Workflow for Implementing GitHub Classroom.
